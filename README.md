# Network Traffic Analysis

## Objective

To demonstrate proficiency in packet analysis and file extraction techniques within a cybersecurity laboratory setting by successfully extracting a file from a captured packet using Wireshark on a Windows 10 virtual machine. This exercise aims to enhance understanding of network traffic inspection, identification of potential security threats, and practical skills in retrieving malicious or suspicious files for further analysis and mitigation.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Windows 10 VM using Virtual Box.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
